All API endpoints (GET /api/accounts, POST /api/start-signups, GET /api/account/{id}/verification-link, GET /api/stream-progress) are functional. Database operations are consistent. Account creation workflow is active. The backend is fully operational and ready for production use. The issue mentioned in the review request about frontend not showing account data is NOT a backend problem - the API correctly returns account data."
